# General Notes on Zombie Factory
Followed the first three lessons from https://cryptozombies.io/ to understand coding smart contracts.

### Notes
* similar to Java it seems
* in solidity so not the same as Sui Move but helpful
* learned about general coding principles and syntax specific function headers
  * external --> to be called by other people but more restrictive than "public"
* made multiple files that interacted with each other
  * interfaces
  * calling public functions
  * calling functions from published smart contracts
  * etc
