### Research on Use Cases and User Stories

# Use Cases
1. Sophia --> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case 
* Use case: usage scenario for a piece of software, used to suggest where a piece of software may be useful or a scenario where a system receives an external request and responds
* Defines interactions between an actor and a system to achieve a goal
* Technique for capturing, modeling and specifying the requirements of a system
* Set of behaviors system may perform
* Types of use cases
    * System
    * Business
    * Essential
* Scope is defined by subject and by goals
* Actors must be able to make decisions, donâ€™t always need to be humans
    * Usually work on behalf of someone else
* Not only text but can also be visual diagrams
* For agile development
    * A requirement model of many diagrams depicting use cases plus textual descriptions or notes are lightweight and enough for small projects
* Benefits
    * Provides a short summary of what is expected
    * Provides context for features
    * User focused
    * Better communication
    * Quality requirements
    * Testing and user documentation

# User Story
1. Sophia --> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story
* User story: informal natural language description of a features of a software story
    * Written from perspective of an end user
    * Recorded on post it notes
    * Type of boundary object
    * Facilitate communication and system context
* Influence functionality of system being developed
* Example: As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>
* Describe what may be built in the software product
* Prioritized by customer
* Acceptance criteria
    * Notes about what the story must do in order for the product owner to accept it as complete
* User story vs use case
    * User story
        * Smaller scale and easy to use presentation
    * Use case
        * Organize requirements to form a narrative of how users relate to and use a system
        * Focus on user goals
        * Describe sequences of interactions
