### Research on Use Cases and User Stories

# Use Cases
Bonnie: https://www.wrike.com/blog/what-is-a-use-case/#:~:text=The%20system%20is%20represented%20by,and%20the%20system's%20use%20cases
* Use case: concept to describe how a system can be used to achieve specific goals or task
    * Outlines interactions between users/actors and system to achieve a specific outcome
    * Describe ways in which a user interacts with a system or product
    * Establish success/failure scenarios and critical variations/exceptions
    * Can be written/visualized with help of use case model tool
* History of Use Case:
    * 1987: Swedish Computer Scientist Ivar Jacobsen presented first article on use cases
    * Use cases was used at telecommunications company Ericsson to capture system requirements
* Purpose of Use Case:
    * Manage scope
    * Establish requirements
    * Outline ways user will interact with a system
    * Visualize system architecture
    * Communicate tech requirements to business stakeholders
    * Risk management
* Why Project Managers need to know about Use Cases?
    * They help communicate strategy to stakeholders and bridge gap between business justification and tech requirements
* How to Write Use Case for Project
    * System: the product, service, or software under discussion
    * Actors: a user that exhibits behavior when interacting with the system
        * 4 types of actors: a system under discussion, internal actor, primary actor, and secondary actor
    * Scenario: specific sequence of actions and interactions between actors and system under discussion
    * Use Case: outlines the success/failure scenarios that occur when actor(s) interact with the system
* Example of use case
    * Use case for meal delivery app: Individuals can use an app to place food orders directly to restaurants. When the user places an order, they are prompted to pay through the app or pay when the food arrives. Once that is confirmed, the restaurant will receive a request through their system. The food will then be prepared, packaged, and delivered to the individual. In this case, the app must be able to receive orders, process payments, and communicate with the restaurant electronically. 
    * System: Food delivery app
    * Primary actor: Customer ordering a meal
    * Scenario: User browses restaurant options and selects their food. Order and pay through the app. Food order is sent to restaurant’s internal system and restaurant worker receives and processes order
* Use Case Model
    * Use case model: visual representation of interactions between an actor and system
    * They depict processes, which help to further express preconditions and triggers
    * Commonly expressed using UML (universal modeling language)
    * System is represented by a rectangle or boundary box
    * Actors are shown as stick figures outside of boundary box, while use cases are text in ovals within box
    * Solid and dashed lines represent association between actors and system’s use cases
* Difference between Use Case Model and Use Case Diagram
    * Use case diagram is type of use case model
    * Use case diagram uses text and shapes to represent relationship between user and system
    * Use case diagrams are used to:
        * Visualize flow and behavior of system
        * Illustrate functionality of system
        * Represent key system-user interactions


# User Story

10 Tips for Writing Good User Stories
1. Users Come First
    * User story describes how customer employs the product (it’s told from user’s POV)
    * User stories help capture a specific functionality
    * Carry out user research before writing any user stories
2. Use Personas to Discover the Right Stories
    * Personas are fictional characters that are base on first-hand knowledge of the target group
    * Personas help capture insights about the users/customers
    * They usually consist of a name and picture; relevant characteristics, behaviors, and attitudes; and a goal
    * Persona goals help you discover the right stories
    * The goal is the benefit the persona wants to achieve, or the problem the character wants to see solved by using the product
3. Create Stories Collaboratively
    * User stories are supposed to help you move fast
    * Stories should never be handed off to the development team, but they should be embedded in a conversation
    * The product owner and team should discuss stories together
    * To leverage the creativity and knowledge of the team and results in better user stories, write stories collaboratively as part of the product backlog refinement process
    * If can’t collaborate, then consider use cases
4. Keep Stories Simple and Concise
    * Write your stories so they’re easy to understand
    * Avoid confusing and ambiguous terms, and use active voice
    * Focus on what’s important
5. Start with Epics
    * An epic is a big, sketchy, coarse-grained story
    * Typically broken into several user stories over time
    * Leveraging user feedback on early prototypes and product increments
    * Starting with epics allows you to sketch the product functionality without committing to details
    * Helpful for describing new products and features: allows you to capture rough scope and buying you time to learn more about how to best address needs of users
    * Reduces time and effort required to integrate new insights
6. Refine Stories Until They are Ready
    * Break your epics into smaller, detailed stories until they are ready
    * All development team members should have a shared understanding of the story’s meaning
7. Add Acceptance Criteria
    * As your break epics into smaller stories, remember to add acceptance criteria
    * Acceptance criteria allow you to describe the conditions that have to be fulfilled so that the story is done
    * The criteria enrich the story, make it testable, and ensure that your story can be demoed or released to users and other stakeholders
    * Use 3-5 acceptance criteria for detailed stories
8. Use Cards
    * User stories emerged in Extreme Programming (XP), and early XP literature talks about story cards rather than user stories
    * User stories used to be captured on paper cards
    * 3 benefits of this approach:
        1. Paper cards are cheap and easy to use
        2. Facilitates collaboration: everyone take a card and jot down an idea
        3. Cards can be easily grouped on table or wall to check for consistency and completeness and to visualize dependencies
    * Trello is example of virtual cards
9. Keep Stories Visible and Accessible
    * Don’t hide them on a network drive, corporate intranet jungle, or a licensed tool
    * Make them visible by putting them on a wall
    * This fosters collaboration, creates transparency, and makes it obvious when you add too many stories too quickly
10. Don’t Solely Rely on User Stories
    * Creating a great user experience requires more than user stories
    * User stories help capture product functionality, but they aren’t well suited to describe the user journeys and visual design
    * Complement user stories with other techniques, such as, story maps, workflow diagrams, storyboards, sketches, and mockups
    * User stories aren’t good for capturing technical requirements
    * Write technical stories or use modeling language like UML when describing what an architectural element like a component or service should do
    * User stories are useful for when you develop software that’s likely to be used
