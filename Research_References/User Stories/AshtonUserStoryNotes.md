  * Use Case Analysis
    * Design a system from user perspective
    * Communicate system behavior is user terms
    * Specifying external behaviors
  * Steps
    * Realization
      * General outline
      * Rough breakdown of the processes, actors, and data required for the system
    * Description
      * Design oriented
      * Describe behavior visible to end user
      * Ensure that internally completed processes are visible externally
      * Provide just enough detail to group processes into classes
    * Analysis Classes
      * Narrows down the class list into those classes that are capable of performing the behavior needed to make the system function successfully
    * Responsibilities
      * Outline responsibilities for each class
      * Ensures that each class can perform responsibilities that the exclusively can perform
    * Associations
      * 4 steps
        * Identify the classes to be used
        * Identify possible relationships between classes
        * For those with relationships, describe the nature of the relationship
        * If applicable, identify the multiplicity of the relationship, meaning determine how many of the first class correspond to one object in the second class of the relationship
    * Behavior
      * Outline behavior of each class derived from the responsibilities of each class
    * Describe Attributes
      * Attributes essential for each class
    * Mechanisms
      * Provide solution to each relationship and attribute

**Ashton: DanNorth-Stories.pdf**
  * Basic unit of functionality
  * Shared understanding of “done”
  * Story Structure
    * Title
      * Should describe an activity and actual behavior
      * ATM behavior vs Account Holder Withdraws Cash
    * Narrative
      * As a [role] I want [feature] so that [benefit]
    * Acceptance Criteria (provided through scenarios)
      * Scenario Title should describe difference
      * Scenarios should be described through givens, events, and outcomes
